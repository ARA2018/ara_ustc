Advanced Real Analysis, USTC, 2018 Fall

* 课程公告：第一章作业做奇数题，十月12日上课交，不接受补交。祝国庆快乐！

* 课程信息：

  * 课程简介：This course is to introduce the basic concepts and techniques in Real Analysis. We try to incorporate some results about several important geometric and functional inequalities in Analysis & PDE, after introducing some measure theory, L^p space theory and Fourier transform. Surely, rearrangement inequalities will be studied, which plays an important role in many extremal problems.

  * 教材：Analysis，Lieb&Loss
  
  * 参考书:

   > 1. Textbook: Analysis, Elliott Lieb, Michael Loss. 

   > 2. Real Analsis, Folland

   > 3. Real Analysis, Elias Stein,Rami Shakarchi

   > 4. Prerequisites: Calculus, Basci Real Analysis (e.g.实变函数,周民强)

  * 作业： 
   > 1. You need to submit your homework each time for each chapter together.
   > 2. If unfortunately there are too many exercises in the chapter, by which I mean the number is strictly bigger than (>) 10, you only need to give those with odd numbers (then, your job is halved~).
   > 3. Homework Due: submit before the next class after we finished the chapter in the main lecture.

  * 习题课：TBA
